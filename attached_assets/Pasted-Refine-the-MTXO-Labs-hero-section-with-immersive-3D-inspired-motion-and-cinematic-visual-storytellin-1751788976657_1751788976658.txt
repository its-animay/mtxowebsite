Refine the MTXO Labs hero section with immersive 3D-inspired motion and cinematic visual storytelling. The current layout and glow are great — now enhance the background and ambient atmosphere to feel alive, intelligent, and limitless."

🔭 Background & Environment Enhancements:
Floating 3D Geometries:

Add multiple softly rotating wireframe polygons (e.g., dodecahedrons, octahedrons) in z-space.

Depth layering: fade further objects, bring some closer to gently parallax with scroll or mouse movement.

Use three.js, Spline, or animated SVG/Canvas layers.

Ambient Particles (Stars & Grids):

Add two layers of background particles:

One large, slow-moving layer of star particles that drift diagonally or radially.

One faster, smaller grid or square particles that move on the z-axis (in and out).

Use Canvas, three.js, or animated divs with blur and fade.

Aurora Glow or Nebula Fog:

Soft animated gradient blob (purple-blue) behind the text.

Subtle pulsing and shifting — like a galaxy expanding.

Use blur masks and radial motion paths.

🎬 Motion Refinements:
Parallax mouse movement for floating objects using framer-motion or mousemove-based translateZ.

Subtle idle floating of text (1-2px slow y-axis wave).

Animate glow bloom on hover over MTXO, labs, or Beyond Imagination.

🧑‍💻 Tech Implementation Suggestions:
Text: Use Framer Motion for sequential reveal.

Background Motion: Use three.js or Canvas API for depth-based floating objects.

Animation Orchestration: Use GSAP timeline or Framer Motion staggerChildren to sync everything smoothly.

Performance Tip: Render only top 1-2 z-index objects on mobile, fall back to static glow image behind text.

🎨 Visual Feel Keywords:
Stargate meets Neuralink

Glowing depth like Apple Vision Pro keynote

Calm but intelligent — space + consciousness + tech

💡 Optional Additions:
Faint grid lines or glowing connection beams moving across the screen slowly.

Hovering Lottie animation spark trail on tagline.

Trigger an ambient sound pulse visualization under the tagline (Beyond Imagination) with hover or scroll.

🎯 Final Objective:
Make the MTXO Labs hero feel like the launch screen of an interstellar AI company — not just text in space, but the digital soul of your brand breathing with light, depth, and cosmic movement.
