Design and code an immersive, fully responsive 3D Hero Section for a next-gen enterprise platform that provides intelligent Voice AI Agents for Customer Support and Sales Automation. The hero should instantly convey futuristic sophistication, enterprise-grade reliability, and a deep tech vibe that‚Äôs also welcoming and human-centered.

üß† Platform Theme:
AI Agents that talk, think, and close ‚Äî for enterprise teams that want automation without losing the personal touch.

üé® Visual and Aesthetic Guidelines:
3D Central Focus: A hero-grade 3D scene using Three.js or Spline that shows:

A stylized holographic AI assistant avatar (minimalist humanoid or abstract orb) speaking with real customers.

Interacting 3D UI panels floating around it ‚Äî like chat windows, CRM data charts, waveform animations.

Animated voice wave particles syncing with the assistant's speech.

Soft glassy surfaces, reflections, light beams, and a translucent gradient atmosphere.

If using Spline, import model URL and embed as interactive iframe.

Layout Composition:

Left Half: Textual call-to-value content.

Headline: Transforming Enterprise Communication with Voice AI Agents

Subheadline: AI agents trained for enterprise sales and support ‚Äî they speak, solve, and sell in real-time.

CTAs: ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Try the Live Demo and üìû Book a Discovery Call (animated hover states)

Right Half: 3D animated scene (responsive scaling and mobile fallback to Lottie or static image).

Typography:

Use a premium, futuristic font pairing (e.g., Space Grotesk for headings, Inter or Satoshi for body).

Texts should use gradients or subtle blurs for a holographic look (blend with background).

Color Scheme:

Dark mode default: deep indigo/navy #0B0F28, accent with electric blue, emerald, violet glows.

Glowy UI panels with glassmorphism: semi-transparent with blur, light reflections, and drop shadows.

Microinteractions:

Use Framer Motion for element entry (slide-in with spring, fade-in of CTA).

Add hover parallax or cursor-follow effect to the 3D model or background lights.

Floating particles and soft ambient motion in background using Canvas/WebGL shaders.
