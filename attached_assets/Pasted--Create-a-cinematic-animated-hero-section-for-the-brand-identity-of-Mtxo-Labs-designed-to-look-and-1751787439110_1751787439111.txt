"Create a cinematic, animated hero section for the brand identity of Mtxo Labs, designed to look and feel like a tech origin story title screen. Each part of the animation should be intentional, timed, and elegant, blending motion, glow, and futuristic minimalism.

💥 Animation Flow:
1. Sequential Character Reveal: M → T → X → O
Each letter fades or zooms into place one-by-one (0.4s each with 0.1s stagger)

Use motion blur, scale bounce, and light flare swipe per letter

Light sweep or shimmer as each letter lands

2. 'labs' Slide-in Subtitle
After O, delay 0.8s ➝ slide in labs from the right or bottom

Use soft blur to sharp reveal transition with a glowing white or aurora-blue neon outline

Add low-opacity backdrop behind labs to contrast it over a vibrant background

3. Tagline: Beyond Imagination
Appears under Mtxo Labs, centered, with a delay of 1.4s

Animate with:

Letter-spacing expansion → normal

Glow-up background (aurora pulse or radial gradient flare growing behind text)

Smooth upward fade with glow bloom around text

🎨 Styling & Visual Aesthetics:
Font: Space Grotesk or Geist for futuristic clarity

Main Title: 96–128px, bold, pure white with gradient or glow

'labs': 28–36px, medium weight, translucent neon white with flicker-in feel

Tagline: 20–28px, italic or spaced, glow + blur in soft purple/blue hues

🌌 Background Animation:
Keep current floating crystal/gem 3D environment

Add:

Slowly rotating geometric shapes in z-depth

Light particle trails moving outward from center

Aurora fog sweep in the background using radial shaders or layered Lottie/Canvas elements

🎛️ Technical Specs:
Tech: React + Tailwind + Framer Motion (or Webflow/Lottie if no code)

Easing: spring or easeOutExpo for dramatic entrance

Mobile fallback: Static Mtxo Labs + glowing background with subtle pulse loop

Performance: GPU optimized, use lazy loading for non-critical layers

✨ Bonus Interactions:
Hover on Mtxo = shimmer or pulse glow

Scroll-triggered particle halo expands subtly as user moves down

CTA buttons below tagline can animate into frame later (Explore, Enter, etc.)

🧠 Brand Tone:
Majestic, Mystical, yet Enterprise-grade

Feels like the birth of an AI-powered legend
