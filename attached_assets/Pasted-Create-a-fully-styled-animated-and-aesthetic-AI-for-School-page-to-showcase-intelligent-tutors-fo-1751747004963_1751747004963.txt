Create a fully styled, animated and aesthetic “AI for School” page to showcase intelligent tutors for educational institutions.

🧠 Vision:
Design an interactive and animated marketing page that introduces and explains the concept of AI tutors for schools, allowing institutions to deploy their own branded voice/text AI teachers trained on their own materials.

🧱 Structure & Layout
1. Hero Section – “Your School. Your Content. Our AI.”
Headline:
“AI Tutors Built for Your Students”
“Train your own voice assistant with your content, style, and voice.”

Subtext:
“Empower your classrooms with 24/7 personalized, voice-based AI tutors that know your syllabus.”

Visual:

3D animated classroom scene or floating AI orb surrounded by book icons, syllabus PDFs, and student avatars.

Optional: Institution name engraved on the AI cube or screen.

CTA Buttons:

📥 Upload Your Curriculum

🎤 Talk to Your First AI Tutor

2. Animated Flow Section – How It Works
Use smooth horizontal scroll or step-based vertical sections to show:

📄 Upload your content (PDFs, docs, syllabi)

🧠 AI auto-learns and organizes topics

🧑‍🏫 School chooses tutor personality and tone

🗣️ Students ask questions — AI responds via voice or chat

📊 Admin sees insights, performance, weak areas

Style: Animated icons or a 3D storyboard panel that transitions visually with scroll (Spline or Framer recommended)

3. Personalization Section – Make It Your Own
Cards for:

🧑‍🏫 Custom AI persona: “Mrs. Nair – Class 10 History Tutor”

🗣️ Voice tone & accent selection (friendly, formal, etc.)

🧾 Curriculum tagging: “CBSE / ICSE / Custom”

🎨 Logo, voice, and school colors branding

Motion: On-hover card expansions, avatar pulse, scroll-to-reveal

4. Student Experience Simulation
Add a section that lets a visitor simulate a chat or voice Q&A with the AI tutor.

Style: Animated text exchange with AI bubble + user bubble

Voicewave animation or typewriter effect

Short quiz + feedback visual (student got it wrong → AI explains → student tries again)

Optional Embed: Spline-powered assistant UI with smile/blink animations

5. Value Proposition & Trust Section
⚡ 24/7 AI support

🎧 Voice-first with emotion-aware response
